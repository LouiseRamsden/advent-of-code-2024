>(or how an unpaid intern saved christmas AGAIN!!!)

*I got promoted to ```std::numeric_limits<north_pole_employee_t>.min()+1;``` and to celebrate I have decided to publish my C++ code publicly this year because they still won't pay me a salary*

### code-standards
- All code will be in C/C++ unless explicitly stated otherwise, in which I will place an assert in the function with a note to the implementation or explain the lack there of
- All days are contained within their own class and run in main
- Code may be very messy but that is what happens when you have a deadline, and a lot of christmas cheer to distribute.
